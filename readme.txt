Webpageanalyse is a free analysis tool for websites. We collect domain related data from various sources and condense, analyse and process it. Afterwards we generate a report for every webpage. Beside a complete domain analysis we offer different information like whois, website load time, ip lookip and PageRank as independent tools.
